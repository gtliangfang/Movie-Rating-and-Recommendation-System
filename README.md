# Movie-Rating-and-Recommendation-System

This project implemented a Flask MVC framework for overall construction with user authentication, movie search, movie profile, rating, comment and recommender list features.

In backend, it created a personalized movie recommendation system by collecting the user rating history and search records, then updating the recommender list offline using GraphLab API.
